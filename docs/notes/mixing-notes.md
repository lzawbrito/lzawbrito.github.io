- Triangulate frequency masking by soloing groups of tracks at once 
- BPM to ms: 60,000 / BPM (for quarter note)
- "800hz" is the foundation of the midrange
- If a bass fundamental is conflicting with some other instrument in the lows or low mids, automate a high pass filter
- tempo automation: e.g., for Grace Cathedral Park by red house painters the second verse is 1bpm faster exactly
- Bell EQing a certain freq can have the effect of making the freqs around it seem louder

DRUMS 
----- 
- Low cut/high pass at around 40-50 hz on kick drum can b  ring out punch
- Parallel compress to drywet punchiness
- Multiband on higher frequencies of drums can tighten
- If you want that 90s shoegaze snare sound, it's not just reverb, also low shelf

BASS 
---- 
- boost around 300 brings out that midrangey kinda present bass


MIX BUS
-------
- m/s compression
- Cousins, practical mastering, sec 4.4

distortion can have compressing effect
