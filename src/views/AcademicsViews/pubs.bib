abstract = {We present an open-source software for the simulation of observables in magnetic resonance experiments, including nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance NMR/NQR and electron spin resonance (ESR), developed to assist experimental research in the design of new strategies for the investigation of fundamental quantum properties of materials, as inspired by magnetic resonance protocols that emerged in the context of quantum information science (QIS). The package introduced here enables the simulation of both standard NMR spectroscopic observables and the time-evolution of an interacting single-spin system subject to complex pulse sequences, i.e. quantum gates. The main purpose of this software is to facilitate the development of much needed novel NMR-based probes of emergent quantum orders, which can be elusive to standard experimental probes. The software is based on a quantum mechanical description of nuclear spin dynamics in NMR/NQR experiments and has been widely tested on available theoretical and experimental results. Moreover, the structure of the software allows for basic experiments to easily be generalized to more sophisticated ones, as it includes all the libraries required for the numerical simulation of generic spin systems. In order to make the program easily accessible to a large user base, we developed a user-friendly graphical interface, Jupyter notebooks, and fully-detailed documentation. Lastly, we portray several examples of the execution of the code that illustrate the potential of a novel NMR paradigm, inspired by QIS, for efficient investigation of emergent phases in strongly correlated materials.
Program summary
Program Title: PULSEE (Program for the simULation of nuclear Spin Ensemble Evolution) CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/vvv8tcb2nt.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/vemiBGH/PULSEE Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Python 3 Nature of problem: Applications of nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance techniques to study the properties of materials often requires extensive spectral simulations. On the other hand, the application of magnetic resonance techniques to quantum information science (QIS) involves different sets of observables. Available simulation software address only one of these applications: either detailed spectral simulations [1] or QIS relevant observables [2]. For this reason, NMR has not seen as much development in the condensed matter community compared to other spectroscopy techniques that combine these two approaches. Therefore, there is a need for an up-to-date and easily accessible software that can simulate an extensive set of NMR/NQR experimental observables, reproducing the behavior/response of nuclear systems with varying degree of complexity encountered in strongly correlated quantum materials. Solution method: The open-source Python code provides an extensive set of libraries for the simulation of time evolution of spins in the presence of specific interactions and reproduction of spectra; as well as other observables measured in magnetic resonance experiments; and simulations of quantum circuits and gates. The ready-to-use software features a user-friendly graphical interface, and Jyputer notebooks.
