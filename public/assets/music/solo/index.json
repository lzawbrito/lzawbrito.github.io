The slightest motion due to ensembles through unison cued. I love you too, I do just much too soon to say it too. But kiss me across the room, let lesions bloom, let lesions bloom. Cast in wood, wrought in marble. Kiyo, just as I conjure you it snows. To seize, to sow, to rue, to strike the moon, to find a clue. A soft commotion though the noise you knew, and I knew too. The slightest motion due to ensembles through unison cued. " },

I just read you and I were last seen down by Ives, where the bricks move like tides, lapping up to our heights. We'll get swallowed by time, in the foam of sublime. Riya, breathe, it's alright. Here we neither live nor die. You're once more just a child. Do you hear, oh, the chime? Why are you here my friend? Against a burning band? I see an outstretched hand, its tendons ribboned bands. Beyond the haze we might just find an end, an end before the means, an outstretched ribboned hand. The closing of a book, the sign which it extends, the language of the game, the space inside frame. The closing of a sign, extending in the frame. The space inside the close, the language of the game. Riya, remember, we all love you."},

In a moment, I will speak it. In a moment, I will say your name with mine entwined. In a moment, I will hold you. I will give everything, anytime, anywhere, anything that you want of mine. Hi, Miss Sorrow, remember me? You’re in my walls, moving, I see. I think you borrowed something I need. I need it back, for someone sweet. I have found the one I seek. We're living in a hollow tree. The flow of symbols from prose to seed. The growing body of words in your speech. The hollow fold of the now, soon breached. Your breath is silent but bows gently onto the curve over your lips."},

Essas mortes assim estranhas e tal. E com a chegada desses meninos agora pareçe que eu tô conseguindo resolver isso de alguma maneira, então...\" \\ \"E, Yamandu, o que que é o silêncio?\" \\ \"O silêncio - e agora eu vou roubar uma frase de um moçambicano - o silêncio é a música em estado de gravidez.\"_ \n\n I'm leaving for six months ago, involuted flow. And, Alex, you will let me go, you'll have to let me go. For I miss New England's biting cold, in that cold, we both glow. And, Alex, find me in the folds, when time comes, you will know. You try to open a door that's closed, shake the doorknob that you hold. But you can't open the door, you've never learned before. Beyond's a space without a length, a name without an end. There are no words for it, yet it’s a perfect fit. Folding in twos, folding in fours, you touch me from afar. A beat that forgets itself, a message in a cell. I've read it well, but you see, I've assumed something that isn't true. As it strikes me, the stone that you threw hits my window. While the glass caves in, slowly, I stand up and move to the hallway out my building. But I forgot my keys, my keys. As it strikes me, oh, the stone that you threw hits the window. And the thought sets in, glassy, oh, the fantasy, and I find that it’s rained..." }

And as I do, it seeps in me and thus in you. My blood will mix with yours, in our veins, through our pores. I fade to you, you to me. Like a boar whose bony tusk has sprouted up and punctured through Slowly cutting, white through marrow, I saw it then, you saw it too. You move along a line, you move along a line all the time. All I do is follow you, all you do is follow me. I know, I know. This brings me back to when we were young Walking along the streets of Abolição. And all the men with the cardboard sheets and loudspeakers droning on, saying \"it's ending soon, I hear it too, the boars, the tusks, the me, the you, we turn to one, we turn to two,\" we take a left, and he drowns in- And the wall we'd drive past on our way home, covered in the words of a man no one knew. I think the wall was white and the ink was blue. The bastard managed to put his whole life down on this wall, and so it went on and on and on and on... 'Til the words I love you too, I love you through and through. And I think before the day we moved the ink was fresh and I- \n\nMy friend Meg says her car was stolen. I don't think it was, I don't think things just disappear like that. It probably sunk into the earth while you weren't looking. That happened to my grandmother back in 2008, you know. She suffered from Alzheimer's and moped around the house bumping into things and opening doors that led nowhere, then one day she was alone and she was just gone, never saw her again. And we live about our days as if everything's alright, but take a look around you man, 700 petty thefts in five days. And so much of it food, so much of it food, like a boar whose tusk has sprouted out and punctured through. And what are we to do? If things are just phasing out of existence, sprouting out and puncturing through. Til the words \"I love you too\"..." },
			{ "tab": "/assets/music/solo/ld/mukilteo-speedway.txt", "title": "Mukilteo Speedway", "lyrics": "I feel the same way, I know you want to take my body and dip your hands in it like it's a vessel that will give, and give, it will. Just don't forget me when you're out living through your days. Just don't forget me at the turn of the key, at the crack in the floor, at the fall in the loop, at the loop in the knot, don't- \n\nThis is my world. Take it from me, and I will love you like I-\n\nYou spend all your time looking at me, burying your hands in my hair. It's been too long, you need some sleep, you need me, come to me. I want you to move your arms away from me, please don't touch me. Since I was so young, I've seen you here\n\nMy bones are thin, made of silk. I slip away like I-\n\nThis is my world. Take it from me, and I will love you like I-\n\nI think I was seventeen when I first saw the movie Mukilteo Speedway. I watched the skeleton of the city, peeled by white light, unrolling. I watched three boys underneath a stairway, letting frost through their teeth, letting their time kiss the night, time kiss the night, time kiss the night. I watched you build this world where everyone's coked up and nothing feels either bad or alright." },
			{ "tab": "/assets/music/solo/ld/spider.txt", "title": "Thin Black Spider Across the Lot", "lyrics": "We must have been around thirteen when we went behind the Safeway and drew our names on the fresh tar. Now we've come so far. I went there the other day to see if it had stayed and I couldn't even remember where it was. Was it the sun that closed it up, or is it me misremembering us? Or was it the etching springing up and crawling away like a thin black spider, across the lot onto the streets to squeeze into our ears laying eggs for our next big idea? I saw a sign that said \"where will we go when the water rises?\" I don't know, I don't know, I don't think it will. I think instead the water will fall into the ground, and you and I will be left to find our ways around. And honestly man, I've walked around out of town and it's the same for miles and miles, it's the same...\n\nAnd after locking eyes with that sign I went across the bridge and up the hill and into my building and took a left into my crawlspace. This is where I am, this is where I've been, this is where I will be. The hall is long, as long as time, as long as eternity. And so I move, I move along, I move silently.\n\nCome on, have you seen the headlines, man, things are getting pretty bad in here. We're living in a fun-house mirror, it's getting hot, it's getting— And come on, I've traveled for miles and miles, it's all the same shit everywhere. All the stops—\n\nI saw a sign that said \"we want everything\" on the canal across from us. I want more, I want more, it's not enough. That our atoms will scatter into the ground and we'll all be left to be unbound, unbound, unbound.\n\nA noisy bliss beyond this room, the rain pitter-pattering on my window. Suddenly, I remember being born, I remember being young, I remember I'm alone, I remember I'm alone.\n\nMy grandmother suffered from dementia. She died at 67. Toward the end of her life she had this fear of being inside, couldn't bear it. She'd kick and scream and we'd have to restrain her to take her in the nursing home. And when she was there, this pacified look glazed over her face and suddenly she was placid. During one of these episodes I tried to speak to her and she thought she was in her childhood bedroom in Erexim. Then she thought she was in the house she raised my mother in, and I was her husband. Then she thought she was in a hotel she stayed at in Greece, 1997. And this went on and on for every place she'd ever been in.\n\nWe come alone, we leave alone." },
			{ "tab": "/assets/music/solo/ld/hypercommodity.txt", "title": "Hypercommodity", "lyrics": "Walking down the stairs, to the supermarket, I took a left to my bathroom. Nothing much, just shaking hands with time.\n\nCeramic flooring, as it had always been.\n\n\"I heard a song on the radio yesterday,\" you said, from downstairs. I could hear you through the tiles as the drier went on in the back.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, looking at myself in the mirror.\n\nJust yesterday I had done the same thing.\n\n\"Funny how we come back around like we're looping\" you said through the tiles, as I touched my skin, \"it used to be my favorite song, and now I think it is again.\" I touched my skin. Ceramic flooring, the bathtub's filthy. The ceramic is smooth, I pictured myself slipping on it, hitting my head, and walking down the stairs, to the supermarket.\n\nIt's not enough, give me more, I want more, please give me more, goddamn, please give me more\n\nAs I was about to head out the door you told me: \"Don't forget to pick up the filter.\" I told you I picked up the filter yesterday and you said \"no, I had picked up the filter about a month ago. It had been about a month.\" I said I think remember damn well picking up what I picked up and doing what I did when I did. I saw a retort manifest in your eyes then pass, ephemeral. We both knew it was time for me to head out the door. \"I've done everything I can, ok? I'm trying everything I can and doing all I can think of but it still doesn't seem to get any better, ok? Nothing's cutting it. None of the keys work on this lock, you know?\"\n\nAnd then before I knew it I was walking on the sidewalk. I've done the math inside and outside and forwards and backwards, I've done the math my way, I've done it yours, I've done it right, I've done it wrong. I did it by hand, I did it with computers, I've done it inside and outside and forwards and backwards.\n\nIt's not enough, give me more, I want more, please give me more, goddamn, please give me more\n\nI know. I've done the math inside and outside and forwards and backwards, the ceramic flooring is smaller than it used to be, and none of the keys work on the bathroom lock. As I walked outside I saw the faces of everyone I'd ever seen in my life like they were all waiting for me. I saw every friend I'd ever known, the boy I sat behind in kindergarten, my mother, my father, my lovers. The sun shone above, it made me feel warm. It was only then that I could see myself through them." }

			{ "title": "Flor de Belém", "lyrics": "When I first saw you I tumbled and toiled and labored to hear you, my king. Perched on the skyline, you sounded above me, I laid down and spread out my wings. You listened, I told you: you've hurt me, I love you, I need you, I hate you, my friend. Only now you choose to descend.\n\nTossing and turning, I felt you below me. Your body cold, I touched your mould, I felt you old and somehow lonely. I saw you tread across the power lines, down the only roads you recognized. I asked you where you set your sight, you took a sigh and then replied: \"my, this city quickly broke without me.\"\n\nThe carpenters cleaned you, the weavers had held you, they said you let spill out your name along with with a calling for me, or for anyone: \"beija-me flor de Belém, I know somewhere you're still the same.\" I walked on the granite of your lemon garden; an angel had plucked them for me. The hedgerows had opened, the center unfolded, I walked into your mausoleum. Light strung from heaven, down, like a weapon, cleaving the dust and the green. When did you build this machine?" },
			{ "title": "The Wren", "lyrics": "Sing a song, lover, make it long so that when I'm back you're not yet done.\n\nLet go my hand, lover, it's time to go. I've got your face memorized, your roman nose. Though, years from now, who knows? That face will wane. Time, who draws these aging lines, should cast its shade. So I, drunk on wine, turn away.\n\nAnd the nights start to wind around connecting flights and unbought tickets to Venus. You're just the pin that holds as we spin, coiling on this orrery.\n\nSing a song, lover, make it hurt. Make it known that we leave so much undone.\n\nOur weighed chests, which, brazen, bear a thousand words, each one a silent testament spelling a poem: deixo meu coração em suas mãos, enfim. Então atravesso so esse país, o seu meu lampião. Lá, te vejo lá, n'Abolição.\n\nIs what I'd write, what I'd pen, what I'd say, if only then your wild eyes met mine again.\n\nAnd now I, the wren, am to fly at your command. Yet this bird longs for the cage again." },
			{ "title": "Mary Lit Her Leaves", "lyrics": "I broke into a run at the snap of a gun. My feet went ankle deep into the deluging streets, under the rain and sun. Please, God, I'm done. And from within the earth came a beating drum which sounded as a pulse, bouncing off the raindrops, then to my bones.\n\n Mary lit her leaves, I stood in their smoke. And that moment I knew the lord perched onto me and wouldn't let go. Mary lit her leaves, I stood in their smoke. So as I ran from the men with the gun in their hands, I felt my body burn. Please, God, I'm done.\n\nI called my love with cause to mourn. Embraced, alone she softly told: \"I wish above a light would burn and strip our skins of bark and mold. Instead, the sky drapes, a cloth, punctured by scathing knives.\" And as she closed her hand on mine all those knives were coming down. Please, God, I'm done.\n\n All those years of chemicals at the dry cleaner made Mary's hands spindly and sallowed. But still, as she lit her match there was a preserved elegance to them. All those years of blades at the meatpacker made Joseph's leg atrophied and cold. Still, when he ran and he cried and he ducked it worked just fine, though." },
			{ "title": "Mother", "lyrics": "Oh, mother, come home. This house's so empty without your warmth. The wood sags, the floorboards moan. Your nerves softly hum inside the walls.\n\nRemember last July, when we let the birds escape? I came home, the window ajar, and an empty cage. We followed the trail of feathers down the alleyway. You sat on the garden chair and said \"why won't they stay?\"\n\nOh, mother, come home. Every day I miss you more. If only I had known before what a mother's love is worth.\n\nRemember when, remember when we lived up a dozen floors? You held my hand as I went down, floating to the streets below, gently coasting on Abolição, then sweeping up toward the sun. And all the city's people'd point at the figures sailing on, silhouettes, hand in hand, against the big blue sky.\n\nOh, we age and we mourn. We all leave, we all roam. One day we leave and don't come home. This day will come for you too, mom." }
